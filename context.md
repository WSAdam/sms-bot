# sms-bot — Consolidation Context

This packet is the starting point for consolidating three legacy systems into one Deno Deploy project:

1. **omnisource sms-flow module** — the SMS pipeline (lead intake, ReadyMode injection/scrub, Bland.ai send, Cal.com appointment hook, lead orchestration). Code dump in `_source-omnisource/sms-flow/`.
2. **Daily cron site** — *not* being ported. Replaced by an internal `Deno.cron` job (no external trigger needed).
3. **Deno KV playground** — the dashboards, conversation search, audit search, scheduled-injection UI, nightly Postmark report, KV CRUD, and the existing `/api/guests/activate` + `/api/guests/answered` + `/api/sales/record` endpoints. The user has saved its `main.ts` (renamed to `_legacy-main.ts`) into this folder as the canonical reference.

> **The original spec is below — kept as historical record.** Sections 0 + below "POST-IMPLEMENTATION STATE" reflect actual built state and the deltas + gotchas discovered during implementation. Read those first.

---

## 0. POST-IMPLEMENTATION STATE (current truth as of last commit)

### 0.1 Architecture decisions made

- **Single Fresh project** — Fresh hosts both UI pages (`routes/*.tsx`-style HTML) and API handlers (`routes/api/*`, `routes/sms-callback/*`, `routes/cal/*`, `routes/trigger/*`, `routes/sms-flow/*`). One Deno Deploy project, one URL.
- **NOT JSX/Fresh page templates** — UI pages are served as raw HTML strings extracted verbatim from `_legacy-main.ts` and stored in `shared/ui/pages.ts`. Each route handler returns `new Response(htmlConst, { headers: { "content-type": "text/html; charset=utf-8" }})`. No Fresh page composition for the legacy pages — kept the inline CSS + inline JS that the playground already had.
- **Webhooks at clean paths** — `/sms-callback/*`, `/trigger/*`, `/cal/*`, `/sms-flow/*`. Decided NOT to mount under `/confirmations/v001/` (that was legacy ngrok cruft).
- **Quickbase REAL** (was stub originally) — direct REST API in `shared/services/quickbase/api.ts` + `reservations.ts`. Only `getReport` (the daily cron data pull) still uses the public Cloud Function.
- **Cal.com integration FULL** — `shared/services/cal/service.ts` ports the legacy `CalService` verbatim. Three new routes under `/cal/*`.
- **No external cron, no auth tokens** — `Deno.cron` runs both the every-minute injection sweep and the daily QB sale-match. No `CRON_SHARED_SECRET`, `CRON_INTERNAL_TOKEN`, or `SMS_COUNT_TOKEN` env vars exist anymore. The endpoints are open (manual triggers via Test page).
- **shape-checker abandoned** — fundamentally incompatible with Fresh's `routes/` convention. The script is still wired to `deno task shape-check` for completeness; ignore its output.

### 0.2 Critical gotchas discovered during implementation

1. **Bland send: use `/v1/sms/send`, NOT `/v1/sms/conversations`.** The latter is the "Create SMS Conversation" endpoint which initializes state without sending. We hit `https://api.bland.ai/v1/sms/send` with `{user_number, agent_number, pathway_id, pathway_version, new_conversation: true, request_data}` and **omit `agent_message`** so the pathway generates the opener. The legacy `BlandSmsService.createConversation` was misleadingly named — it actually called `/v1/sms/send`.

2. **Firestore `preferRest: true` is mandatory on Deno Deploy.** firebase-admin's gRPC transport doesn't work — every call hangs 50s and 500s with `14 UNAVAILABLE: No connection established`. Set in `shared/firestore/client.ts` after `getFirestore(app)`. Already wired.

3. **Vite + npm CJS modules require `new Function` for dynamic imports.** Plain `await import("firebase-admin/...")` AND `await import(/* @vite-ignore */ "...")` BOTH fail because @fresh/plugin-vite's deno-loader resolves them anyway. Bundle drops from 5MB → 250KB once you wrap:
   ```ts
   const dynamicImport = new Function("specifier", "return import(specifier)");
   const adminApp = await dynamicImport("firebase-admin/app");
   ```
   Both `shared/firestore/client.ts` and `shared/services/postmark/client.ts` use this pattern.

4. **`Deno.cron` types are gated `unstable` even though it's stable on Deploy.** Use a typed alias:
   ```ts
   type DenoCron = (name: string, schedule: string, handler: () => Promise<void> | void) => void;
   const denoCron = (Deno as unknown as { cron?: DenoCron }).cron;
   if (Deno.env.get("DENO_DEPLOYMENT_ID") && denoCron) { denoCron(...) }
   ```

5. **`QUICKBASE_USER_TOKEN` env value is the raw token string.** Quickbase's "copy as code" UI sometimes hands you a base64-encoded HTTP-headers blob — looks like `Insi…SI=`. Decode that and extract the `b…` token from the Authorization line.

6. **Phone field in QB is queried by formatted string.** `8432222986` → format to `(843) 222-2986` for `EX` queries. Done in `shared/services/quickbase/reservations.ts:formatPhoneForQb`.

7. **Override mode in `processInboundLead` falls through to a stub guest** if the CRM lookup returns null. Without this, the "fire a test SMS to your phone" path can't work until QB has a record for your test resID.

8. **Bland conversation-message webhook receiver was missing originally.** Built at `routes/sms-callback/conversation/[phone]/[callId].ts`. Bland needs to be configured to POST every message there or the dashboard's "People Replied" stays at 0 forever.

### 0.3 Env vars (current canonical list)

| Var | Required | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | ✅ | GCP project ID | `keystone-fs97` |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | ✅ on Deploy | Raw JSON of service account | Paste the whole `{...}` blob |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | ✅ local | Path to service-account JSON file | e.g. `./data/service-account.dev.json` (gitignored) |
| `BLAND_API_KEY` | ✅ | Bland.ai API key | Header: `authorization: <key>` (no Bearer prefix) |
| `NU_BLAND_API_KEY` | optional | Bland fallback key | |
| `BLAND_SMS_PATHWAY_ID` | optional | Pathway override | Default: `d6bd66a2-13b4-4365-a994-842c705e22b1` |
| `BLAND_PATHWAY_VERSION` | optional | Pathway version | Default: `production` |
| `POSTMARK_SERVER` | required for /api/report/nightly | Postmark server token | |
| `QUICKBASE_REPORT_TOKEN` | required for daily cron | `test` body field for `getReports` Cloud Function | |
| `QUICKBASE_USER_TOKEN` | required for direct QB ops | User token from QB My Preferences → Manage user tokens | Raw token only, NOT a base64 headers blob |
| `QUICKBASE_FAIL_OPEN` | optional | `true` (default) = QB outage soft-fails | Flip to `false` once you trust QB wiring |
| `RM_USER`, `RM_PASS` | ✅ | ReadyMode TPI Basic-auth creds | Same creds work for all 5 domains (no per-domain overrides needed) |
| `CAL_API_KEY` | ✅ for Cal.com endpoints | Cal.com v2 API key | `cal_live_…` format |
| `NGROK_KEY` | local dev only | ngrok auth token | For `deno task tunnel` |
| `SOURCE_KV_URL` | migration script only | Legacy KV deploy URL | `https://google-sheets-kv.thetechgoose.deno.net` |

**Removed since original plan:** `CRON_SHARED_SECRET`, `CRON_INTERNAL_TOKEN`, `SMS_COUNT_TOKEN`, `QUICKBASE_REALM` (now hardcoded constant).

### 0.4 Hardcoded constants

In `shared/config/constants.ts`:
- Bland: agent number `+18435488335`, pathway ID `d6bd66a2-…`, version `production`
- Quickbase: realm `monsterrg.quickbase.com`, reservations table `bmhvhc72c`, fields `{ResId:3, Email:78, GuestName:79, Phone:82, SpouseName:84, Dnc:457, TCPA:685}`, bookings table `bpb28qsnn`, report `530`
- Cal.com: API base `https://api.cal.com/v2`, version header `2024-08-13`, event type ID `4650992` (Monster Appointments), holding campaign `ODR_APPT_HOLDING`
- Postmark: from `notifications@monsterrg.com`, default to `adamp@monsterrg.com`
- Throttling: daily cap 100, rate-limit window 30d, attempts threshold 40
- Sale match: 7-day window
- Firestore root: `sms-bot`
- Time: `America/New_York` for all ET-day calculations

### 0.5 Endpoint inventory (current — supersedes §5)

**UI pages** (return HTML from `shared/ui/pages.ts`):
- `GET /` — landing (also handles legacy audit `?recordId` GET / POST)
- `GET /dashboard`, `/search`, `/audit`, `/injections`, `/review`
- `GET /test` — endpoint test console (8 sections, ~25 cards, sticky phone input, override toggle, response preview)
- `GET /healthz` — `{ok:true, service, time}`

**Trigger** (inbound SMS):
- `POST /trigger/manual` — pathway SMS via `/v1/sms/send`. Body `{phone, resID, domain, attempts, override?}`. Override defaults true if omitted (back-compat); `override:false` from Test page exercises real gatekeepers.
- `POST /trigger/readymode` — full gatekeeper path (attempts ≥40, DNC, rate limit, CRM)
- `POST /trigger/test-sms` — raw text via `/v1/sms/send`. Body `{phone, message}`. Bypasses pathway. Used by Custom SMS Test card.

**SMS callbacks** (Bland + Cal.com webhook receivers, dialer dispositions):
- `POST /sms-callback/appointment-booked` — `{phone, event_time}` → scrub source + scheduledInjection
- `POST /sms-callback/disposition` — `{phone, disposition, campaign_name}` → 3-branch (sale/booked = noop, ODR = return-to-source, else = recycle)
- `POST /sms-callback/stop` — `{phone}` → DNC across 5 RM domains + Firestore flag
- `POST /sms-callback/bland/talk-now` — `{phone}` → instant ODR inject
- `POST|GET /sms-callback/return-to-source` — scrub ODR, inject back to original
- `POST /sms-callback/backfill-conversations` — `{conversationIds:[…]}`
- `POST /sms-callback/seed-conversations`, `POST /sms-callback/seed-conversation` — bulk/single Bland history seed
- `GET /sms-callback/list-today` — Bland's today list (sanity check API key)
- `DELETE /sms-callback/conversation-history`, `/sms-callback/cleanup` — testing wipes
- **`POST /sms-callback/conversation/:phone/:callId`** — **NEW.** Bland per-message webhook receiver. Body `{sender, message, nodeTag?}` — phone+callId in body ignored (URL path wins). Sender normalization: `"USER"`/`"GUEST"`/`"Guest"` → `"Guest"`, anything else → `"AI Bot"`. Calls `storeMessage` which writes the callId→phone lookup index FIRST.

**Cal.com**:
- `POST /cal/available-times` — generates 15-min slots, 9–5 ET, 7-day window, future-only
- `POST /cal/schedule` — Cal.com `createBooking` + `scheduleInjection` + auto-tag conversation history with `nodeTag: "appointment scheduled"` + orchestrator events. Fail-safe: SMS injection schedules even if Cal.com errors.
- `POST /cal/delete-scheduled-injection` — cancels both Cal.com booking (if uid given) and the scheduledInjection doc

**SMS-flow**:
- `GET /sms-flow/orchestrator/pointer/:phone`
- `GET /sms-flow/orchestrator/events/:phone`
- `POST /sms-flow/queue/trigger` — `{type:"INJECT_APPT", phone}` → fire-and-forget delayed injection

**API**:
- `GET /api/state`
- `GET|POST|DELETE /api/kv/{get,set,delete,list}` — legacy compat
- `GET /api/dashboard/{stats,drill}`, `GET /api/appointments`
- `GET /api/conversations/{search,search2}`
- `GET /api/audit/{browse,check,status}`, `POST /api/audit/save`
- `POST /api/injection/schedule`, `DELETE /api/injection/cancel`
- `GET /api/cron/trigger` — manual sweep (no auth — Deno.cron also calls)
- `GET /api/cron/trigger-single?phone=…` — fire one phone's scheduled injection now
- `POST /api/sales/record` — single-phone sale match
- `POST /api/guests/activate` — bulk SHA256 phone match (legacy)
- `POST /api/guests/answered` — mark answered
- `POST /api/guests/activate-from-report` — manual trigger for daily QB cron
- `POST /api/sms/count` — today's count (no auth — was token-gated, dropped)
- `GET|POST /api/report/nightly` — Postmark email

### 0.6 Scheduled jobs (Deno.cron, Deploy-only)

In `main.ts`, gated on `DENO_DEPLOYMENT_ID`:
- **`scheduled-injection-sweep`** — every minute (`* * * * *`). Calls `sweepScheduledInjections("cron")`.
- **`daily-qb-sale-match`** — daily at `0 14 * * *` UTC = **10 AM ET / 9 AM EDT**. Calls `runDailyQbSaleMatch()` from `shared/services/sale-match/cron.ts`.

Edit cron expressions in `main.ts` to change schedules. Both also callable via routes for manual firing.

### 0.7 Test console (`/test`)

8 sections, ~25 cards. Each card has:
- Per-card phone input (placeholder `8432222986`); top "global phone" bar fills all
- Inline params (selects, dates, textareas)
- Run button → response panel below (status code colored, elapsed ms, pretty JSON)
- Confirm dialog on every destructive or send-real-SMS action

Sections:
1. **🚀 Trigger inbound SMS** — Manual trigger, Custom SMS, ReadyMode webhook (Manual + ReadyMode have `override=true` checkbox, default unchecked)
2. **📅 Cal.com / Appointment** — Appointment booked, Fire scheduled injection now, Manual schedule injection, Generate available times, Book Cal.com appointment, Cancel Cal.com appointment
3. **📞 Disposition / Hot-path** — Disposition, Talk-now, Return-to-source
4. **🛑 STOP / Opt-out** — STOP request
5. **🔍 Inspect state** — Conversation messages, Lead pointer, Orchestrator events, Config state
6. **📊 Misc writes** — Mark guest answered, Manual sale match, Store Bland message (simulates webhook)
7. **⚙️ Cron / Batch** — Sweep, Daily QB cron, Bland list-today, Dashboard stats, SMS count
8. **🧹 Cleanup (irreversible)** — Full reset, Delete history, Cancel injection

### 0.8 Local dev

```bash
deno task dev          # Fresh on port 5173/5174 with --env-file=env/local
deno task tunnel --env=dev    # ngrok exposing the dev server
deno task test         # 33 unit tests (all mocked)
deno task build        # Vite production build
deno task migrate      # KV → Firestore one-shot
deno task shape-check  # ignore output, structure incompatible with Fresh
```

`env/local` is gitignored (`env/example` is the template). Both `data/` and `env/` are gitignored except `data/*.example` (ngrok yaml templates) and `env/example`.

Service-account JSON for local dev: drop at `data/service-account.dev.json` and set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./data/service-account.dev.json` (default already in `env/local`). Or set `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` with the inline JSON — that takes precedence.

### 0.9 Deploy

- **Project**: Deno Deploy auto-deploys from `main` branch of https://github.com/WSAdam/sms-bot
- **Build**: `deno task build` (Vite). Native Fresh runtime.
- **Bundle health**: server-entry ~305KB, pages chunk ~150KB. firebase-admin + postmark are externalized (resolved at runtime via `npm:` import map).
- **Cron tab in Deploy panel** confirms both Deno.cron jobs registered.
- **Logs**: every request logs ET-time + method + path + status + ms via `routes/_middleware.ts`.

### 0.10 Bland webhook config (cutover guide)

Existing legacy webhook in Bland's pathway/numbers config posts to:
```
https://conf-deploy.ngrok.app/confirmations/v001/cal/conversation/{{from}}/{{callID}}
```

To dual-fire to the new app **clone the webhook** (don't replace yet) and add:
```
https://<new-deploy-url>/sms-callback/conversation/{{from}}/{{callID}}
```

Body shape works as-is (`{phoneNumber, callId, sender, message, nodeTag}`). Path params win over body for phone+callId. Sender values `"AI Bot"` and `"Guest"` both land correctly. Once new endpoint is verified for a few days, remove the legacy webhook.

### 0.11 Migration script

`scripts/migrate-kv-to-firestore.ts` pulls from legacy KV deploy → writes to Firestore.

**Idempotency**: doc paths are deterministic (built from KV key parts). Re-runs OVERWRITE the existing Firestore doc with destructive `set()` (no `{merge:true}`). So:
- ✅ Safe to re-run `conversations`, `auditstage`, `injectionhistory`, `audit` — append-only, unique keys per record
- ⚠️ DON'T re-run `scheduledinjection`, `smsflowcontext` after cutover — one row per phone, would clobber any fresh writes from the live app

Run per-prefix:
```bash
deno task migrate -- --prefix=conversations --limit=10000
deno task migrate -- --prefix=audit --dry-run
```

Optional future enhancement: `--skip-existing` flag (does `.get()` first) for truly safe re-runs. Not built yet.

### 0.12 What's NOT done (vs. original plan)

- **Emulator tests** (`tests/emulator/*`) — never built. All 33 tests are unit + mocked.
- **MostRecentPackage QB fields** — `MostRecentPackageIdDateOfBooking`, `MostRecentPackageIdCreditCardType`, `MostRecentPackageIdLast4OfCreditCardOnly` come back as empty strings from `findReservationByResID`. They're on a related Packages table (`bttffb64u`) and need a follow-up join. Bland pathway gets empty strings — no error, just no booking-detail interpolation.
- **Phase 6 cleanup** — `_source-omnisource/` and `_legacy-main.ts` still in repo as references.
- **Cal.com webhook receiver** (Cal.com → us, for booking events from outside) — not built. We initiate bookings, Cal.com doesn't currently call us.
- **Per-domain RM creds** — env vars exist conceptually but `RM_USER`/`RM_PASS` covers all 5 domains in practice.

### 0.13 Memory rules (Adam's preferences)

- **Never add `Co-Authored-By` to git commits** — commits are attributed to Adam alone.
- **Never push without explicit approval** — commit freely, but ask before `git push`. Silence/acknowledgment doesn't count as approval.

---

## 1. Project goals

- **Single Deno Deploy app** at `~/Programming/sms-bot/` serving every endpoint that the three legacy systems served.
- **Firestore-backed** (replacing the existing Deno KV deploy at `google-sheets-kv.thetechgoose.deno.net`). All writes go to a single root collection `sms-bot`. Service account is already provisioned by the user.
- **One-time historical migration** from existing Deno KV → Firestore via [scripts/migrate-kv-to-firestore.ts](scripts/migrate-kv-to-firestore.ts).
- **New "sale match" flow:** a daily cron-fired endpoint pulls a Quickbase report of phones booked today and marks each as a sale (within a 7-day-from-appointment window) for productivity reporting.
- `Deno.test` coverage as we go; `shape-checker` (run from the project root) to keep file structure sane.

## 3. Architecture

**Process:** single Deno Deploy isolate. `Deno.serve` + a path-based router. No NestJS — the omnisource `@nestjs/common` decorators are stripped during port; constructors become factory functions, classes become objects of methods.

**Storage:** Firestore (not Deno KV). Single root collection `sms-bot`. The legacy code uses HTTP-fronted Deno KV; we replace `SmsFlowStateService.request(...)` with direct Firestore SDK calls via a thin wrapper that exposes `get/set/delete/list(prefix)` so the playground's existing route handlers can be ported with minimal changes.

**Cron:** the daily external cron site continues to exist outside this project. It POSTs to `/api/guests/activate-from-report` (see §6). Inside the app, the playground's `/api/cron/trigger` endpoint also remains for processing scheduled SMS injections — it can be triggered by Deno Deploy's built-in cron or the same external cron site.

**Outbound calls:** Bland.ai (SMS), Postmark (email), Quickbase (reads), ReadyMode (5 dialer subdomains, lead inject/scrub/DNC), and the two ngrok tunnels for `talk-now` callbacks (`conf-deploy.ngrok.app` prod, `conf-omnisource.ngrok.app` test).

---

## 4. End-to-end flows

### 4.1 Inbound lead → first SMS sent

1. ReadyMode dialer POSTs `POST /trigger/readymode` (or test path `POST /trigger/manual` with `?override=true`).
2. Gatekeepers (skipped if `override=true`):
   - attempts ≥ 40
   - global daily SMS count < 100 (Eastern Time)
   - DNC check (Quickbase + KV opt-out flag)
   - 30-day rate limit (per phone)
3. CRM enrichment via Quickbase magic-mirror (lookup by ResID).
4. A/B variant toggle (Firestore-backed).
5. Conversation history fetched.
6. SMS send via Bland.ai (pathway `d6bd66a2-13b4-4365-a994-842c705e22b1`, agent `+18435488335`, `pathway_version: "production"`).
7. Persist SMS flow context, lead pointer, orchestrator event.
8. Response: `{status: "success", variant: "A"|"B"}`.

### 4.2 Guest replies → conversation continues

Bland.ai webhooks externally; the conversation messages get stored under `sms-bot/conversations/messages/{...}` keyed by phone10 + callId + timestamp. The playground's `/search` UI + `/api/conversations/search2` query this.

### 4.3 Guest opts in → Cal.com sends invite → appointment booked

1. Cal.com (or Bland flow) POSTs `POST /sms-callback/appointment-booked` with `{phone, event_time}`.
2. Scrub the lead from its current ReadyMode source domain (read pointer → ReadyMode TPI scrub).
3. Save `sms-bot/scheduledinjections/byPhone/{phone10}` = `{phone, eventTime, scheduledAt, isTest}`.
4. The Deno Deploy cron (or external cron) hits `GET /api/cron/trigger` periodically. That handler iterates `scheduledinjections/byPhone/*`, finds entries whose `eventTime <= now`, POSTs to the appropriate `talk-now` ngrok URL, writes a `injectionhistory` record, and deletes the scheduled-injection doc.

### 4.4 Call ends → disposition handled

1. Dialer POSTs `POST /sms-callback/disposition` with `{phone, disposition, campaign_name?}`.
2. If disposition is `sale`/`booked`: do nothing (lead exits funnel).
3. Else if currently in ODR (or ODR-mapped campaign): scrub from ODR, return to original source domain.
4. Else: standard recycle — scrub source, inject into recycle target if mapped.

### 4.5 Guest opts out → STOP

1. POST `/sms-callback/stop` with `{phone}`.
2. Mark DNC in Quickbase + Firestore opt-out flag (`doNotText: true` on conversation entries / a dedicated `dnc/byPhone/{phone10}` doc).

### 4.6 Daily sale match (NEW)

1. External cron POSTs `POST /api/guests/activate-from-report` with empty body once per day.
2. Server fetches the bookings report from Quickbase: `POST https://us-central1-crm-sdk.cloudfunctions.net/getReports` body `{test: <env QUICKBASE_REPORT_TOKEN>, tableID: "bpb28qsnn", reportID: "530"}`.
3. Response shape: `{data: [{"48": {value: "(XXX) XXX-XXXX"}, "-1": {value: "YYYY-MM-DD"}, "-100": {value: "7 Days"}, "-101": {value: "Active Date Legs"}}, ...]}`. Field `48` is the phone (formatted, normalize to 10 digits).
4. For each phone10:
   - Look up `sms-bot/scheduledinjections/byPhone/{phone10}`.
   - If present and `eventTime` was within the last 7 days, write `sms-bot/saleswithin7d/byPhone/{phone10}` with `{phone10, phone11, appointmentAt, saleAt, windowDays: 7, withinDays, updatedAt}`.
   - Also write `sms-bot/guestactivated/byPhone/{phone10}` with `{phone10, Activated: true, activatedAt, eventTime}` for dashboard parity.
5. Return summary: `{processed, matched, skipped}`.

This is the same logic as `/api/sales/record` in the playground, just batched and self-driven.

## 6. Firestore schema

Single root collection: **`sms-bot`**. Beneath it, one document per data category, each holding a subcollection (or further docs) with the actual records. This keeps the project's data fully isolated under one collection name as required.

```

**Recommended Firestore indexes** (composite — define in `firestore.indexes.json`):
- `sms-bot/conversations/messages` — `(phoneNumber asc, timestamp desc)`, `(sender asc, timestamp desc)`, `(nodeTag asc, timestamp desc)`
- `sms-bot/injectionhistory/byPhone` — `(phone asc, firedAt desc)`
- `sms-bot/scheduledinjections/byPhone` — `(eventTime asc)` for the cron sweep

---

## 7. KV → Firestore migration

### Prerequisites

- Service account JSON for the user's GCP project (already exists).
- Firestore in **Native mode** (not Datastore mode) on that project. If not enabled yet:
  - GCP Console → Firestore → Create database → "Native mode" → choose region.
- Deno installed locally.

### Run the migration

```bash
cd ~/Programming/sms-bot

GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service-account.json \
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id \
SOURCE_KV_URL=https://google-sheets-kv.thetechgoose.deno.net \
deno run -A scripts/migrate-kv-to-firestore.ts --dry-run
```

Once the dry-run output looks right, drop `--dry-run`:

```bash
deno run -A scripts/migrate-kv-to-firestore.ts
```

To migrate one prefix at a time (recommended for the large `conversations` prefix):

```bash
deno run -A scripts/migrate-kv-to-firestore.ts --prefix=conversations --limit=50000
```

### What the script does

- Iterates each known KV prefix (`conversations`, `scheduledinjection`, `smsflowcontext`, `guestactivated`, `guestanswered`, `audit`, `auditstage`, `saleswithin7d`, `injectionhistory`, `config`).
- Calls `POST {SOURCE_KV_URL}/api/kv/list` with `{prefix: [<name>], limit: <n>}` to enumerate every entry.
- Transforms each KV key → Firestore doc path per the schema in §6, preserves `value`, and stores the original KV key in a `_kvKey` field on each doc for traceability.
- Writes via Firestore batch (max 400 ops per batch).

### Caveats

- The legacy `/api/kv/list` endpoint does **not** support cursor pagination — it just returns up to `limit` entries in one shot. For prefixes larger than ~10k entries, either:
  - Bump `--limit` to a high number and trust the request to complete, or
  - Add cursor support to the legacy endpoint before running.
- The script is idempotent for fixed-key prefixes (re-running overwrites the same doc). For `conversations` and `injectionhistory` (which use composed deterministic IDs), reruns also overwrite.

---

## 8. Quickbase requirements

You'll wire up the Quickbase service yourself using context from your other project. The new sms-bot app needs the following operations to exist on whatever client you provide. List shows: **operation → input → expected output → why it's needed**.

| Operation | Input | Output | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `getReport(tableID, reportID)` | `tableID: string`, `reportID: string` | `{data: Array<{[fid: string|number]: {value: any}}>, fields: [...], metadata: {...}}` | Daily sale-match flow (`/api/guests/activate-from-report`) — fetches phones booked today |
| `findReservationByResID(resId)` | `resId: string` | `{phone, firstName, lastName, email?, ... }` or `null` | CRM enrichment during inbound lead processing (porting from omnisource `crm/mod.ts`) |
| `markDNC(phone)` | `phone: string` (10-digit) | `{success: boolean}` | STOP/opt-out handling (`/sms-callback/stop`) |
| `isDNC(phone)` | `phone: string` | `boolean` | Gatekeeper before sending SMS |

**Auth model:** The known `getReports` endpoint is the public Cloud Function `https://us-central1-crm-sdk.cloudfunctions.net/getReports` and is gated by the `test` body field acting as a shared-secret token. Other operations may need a Quickbase user token / app token / temporary auth token — your existing project will tell us what's needed. Document the auth pattern here once known:

- Env var name(s): `QUICKBASE_REPORT_TOKEN` (the `test` field for `getReports`); `QUICKBASE_USER_TOKEN` (likely needed for direct table writes/reads); other?
- Scopes/permissions required:
- Realm/host (e.g. `monsterrg.quickbase.com`):

**Reference response shape for `getReport(tableID="bpb28qsnn", reportID="530")`:**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "48":   { "value": "(936) 676-2277" },
      "-1":   { "value": "2026-04-20" },
      "-100": { "value": "7 Days" },
      "-101": { "value": "Active Date Legs" }
    }
  ],
  "fields": [
    { "id": 48,   "label": "Reservation - Phone Number", "type": "phone" },
    { "id": -1,   "label": "Added", "type": "date" },
    { "id": -100, "label": "Expiry Date", "type": "text" },
    { "id": -101, "label": "Reason", "type": "text" }
  ],
  "metadata": { "numFields": 4, "numRecords": 110, "totalRecords": 110, "skip": 0 }
}
```

The phone in field `48` is formatted `(XXX) XXX-XXXX` — normalize to 10 digits before lookup.

---

## 9. Bland.ai requirements

- **API base:** `https://api.bland.ai/v1/sms/conversations`
- **Auth:** `Authorization: <api_key>` header (no `Bearer` prefix in legacy code — verify against Bland docs).
- **Pathway ID:** `d6bd66a2-13b4-4365-a994-842c705e22b1` (overrideable via `BLAND_SMS_PATHWAY_ID` env var).
- **Pathway version:** `production` (currently hardcoded; consider env-toggling).
- **Agent number:** `+18435488335`.
- **Inbound webhook target:** Bland.ai is configured to POST to the `talk-now` ngrok tunnel; once the new app is deployed, repoint that webhook to the new public URL.
- Operations to port from omnisource: create conversation, list today's conversations, fetch/seed conversation messages, trigger talk-now.
- Env vars: `BLAND_API_KEY`, `NU_BLAND_API_KEY` (legacy fallback), `BLAND_SMS_PATHWAY_ID` (optional override).

---

## 10. Postmark requirements

- **Library:** `npm:postmark` (`ServerClient`).
- **From:** `notifications@monsterrg.com`.
- **To (default):** `adamp@monsterrg.com`.
- **Used by:** `/api/report/nightly` (HTML email with stats table + conversations CSV attached).
- Env var: `POSTMARK_SERVER` (Postmark server token).

---

## 11. ReadyMode requirements

5 dialer subdomains, each with its own `lead-api` slug for lead injection (3 of 5) and a `TPI/lead` scrub endpoint (all 5). Defined in `_source-omnisource/sms-flow/readymode/config/mod.ts`.

| Domain key | Host | Lead-API slug | Has injection? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MONSTER` | `https://monsterrg.readymode.com` | `8qhAtb6vnrxb` | ✅ |
| `ODS` | `https://monsterods.readymode.com` | `s2fyaY95pAC2` | ✅ |
| `ODR` | `https://monsterodr.readymode.com` | `wCoocn6CrCZc` | ✅ |
| `ACT` | `https://monsteract.readymode.com` | — | ❌ scrub only |
| `DS` | `https://monsterrd2.readymode.com` | — | ❌ scrub only |

**Auth:** Basic auth with `RM_USER`/`RM_PASS` (or per-domain `RM_{DOMAIN}_USER`/`RM_{DOMAIN}_PASS`). Legacy code defaults to hardcoded `adam`/`Winter123` if env vars are missing — replace defaults with explicit env vars in the new app and fail fast if missing.

**Operations:**
- `injectLead(domain, params)` → `POST {host}/lead-api/{slug}`
- `scrubLead(domain, phone)` → `POST {host}/TPI/lead` with scrub flag
- `markDNC(domain, phone)` → `POST {host}/TPI/DNC`

Field mappings live in `_source-omnisource/sms-flow/readymode/mapping/mod.ts` (normalize inbound webhook → standardLead, then denormalize standardLead → per-domain payload).

---

## 12. Cal.com integration

Cal.com is the booking layer. The relevant touchpoint is `POST /sms-callback/appointment-booked` — Cal.com (or whatever sits in front of Cal.com) hits that endpoint when a guest books, with `{phone, event_time}`. The new app:

1. Resolves the lead's current source domain via `leadpointer/byPhone/{phone10}`.
2. Scrubs from that domain.
3. Writes `scheduledinjections/byPhone/{phone10}` with `eventTime: event_time`.

No outbound Cal.com API calls are needed in this consolidation — Cal.com pushes to us, we don't pull. If/when that changes, document the API key and endpoint here.

---

## 13. Env vars (full list)

| Name | Purpose | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | GCP project hosting the Firestore DB | ✅ |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (local) **or** `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (Deno Deploy, raw JSON string) | Service account auth | ✅ |
| `BLAND_API_KEY` | Bland.ai SMS auth | ✅ |
| `NU_BLAND_API_KEY` | Bland.ai legacy fallback | optional |
| `BLAND_SMS_PATHWAY_ID` | Override default pathway | optional |
| `POSTMARK_SERVER` | Postmark server token | ✅ (for nightly report) |
| `QUICKBASE_REPORT_TOKEN` | The `test` body field for the `getReports` Cloud Function | ✅ |
| `QUICKBASE_USER_TOKEN` | Quickbase API user token (if direct API access is needed) | TBD |
| `QUICKBASE_REALM` | Quickbase realm host (e.g. `monsterrg.quickbase.com`) | TBD |
| `RM_USER` / `RM_PASS` | ReadyMode default Basic auth | ✅ |
| `RM_MONSTER_USER` / `RM_MONSTER_PASS` | Per-domain override | optional |
| `RM_ODS_USER` / `RM_ODS_PASS` | Per-domain override | optional |
| `RM_ODR_USER` / `RM_ODR_PASS` | Per-domain override | optional |
| `RM_ACT_USER` / `RM_ACT_PASS` | Per-domain override | optional |
| `RM_DS_USER` / `RM_DS_PASS` | Per-domain override | optional |
| `KV_SERVICE_URL` | NOT used by new app — only the migration script uses it (renamed `SOURCE_KV_URL`) | n/a |
| `CRON_SHARED_SECRET` | Shared secret the external cron site sends in a header so `/api/guests/activate-from-report` can reject random callers | recommended |
| `SMS_COUNT_TOKEN` | The `test` body field for `/api/sms/count` (currently hardcoded base64 in playground — extract to env) | recommended |

---

## 14. Daily cron contract

External cron site (already exists) hits the new app once per day with:

```
POST /api/guests/activate-from-report
Content-Type: application/json
X-Cron-Secret: <CRON_SHARED_SECRET>
(empty body)
```

Server fetches the Quickbase report itself (see §8), processes matches, returns:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "fetchedFromReport": 110,
  "matched": 14,
  "skippedNoInjection": 90,
  "skippedOlderThan7Days": 6,
  "matches": [{ "phone10": "9366762277", "appointmentAt": "...", "withinDays": 3 }, ...]
}
```

The legacy `/api/cron/trigger` endpoint also stays — it may be triggered by a separate cron or by Deno Deploy's built-in cron API to process scheduled SMS injections every minute.

---

## 15. Gotchas (from omnisource)

- **No injection lock.** A previous lock mechanism caused triple-injections; it was removed in favor of a preemptive scrub. Don't reintroduce a lock without testing.
- **Conversation lookup race.** The `lookup_call_id → phone` secondary index must be written *before* messages are stored or `getConversationByCallId` will fail. Backfill endpoint exists in legacy code (callback/mod.ts:735); port it.
- **`?override=true` skips everything.** All gatekeepers (attempts, daily cap, DNC, rate limit) bypassed. Used only by `/trigger/manual`.
- **Global daily SMS cap = 100, hardcoded, Eastern Time.** Lives at one shared counter, not per-domain.
- **Hardcoded ReadyMode credentials.** Legacy defaults to `adam`/`Winter123` if env vars missing. New app should fail fast instead.
- **`pathway_version: "production"` is hardcoded.** No env toggle in legacy; consider adding one.
- **Quickbase magic-mirror returns array-like, not Promise.** Legacy code does `.sortByDateModified("desc")[0]` — verify behavior when porting.
- **Conversation seeding has built-in delays.** 100ms between messages, 300ms between conversation IDs, to avoid overwhelming remote KV. With Firestore batched writes this is no longer needed, but verify Bland API rate limits separately.
- **Talk-now scrub is optional.** Proceeds even if no source domain is on the lead pointer.
- **Ngrok tunnel aliases.** `conf-deploy.ngrok.app/confirmations/v001/sms-callback/bland/talk-now` (prod) and `conf-omnisource.ngrok.app/confirmations/v001/sms-callback/bland/talk-now` (test) currently route to the legacy app. After deploy, either repoint the tunnels at the new Deno Deploy URL **or** mount the new handlers under `/confirmations/v001/...` so the existing tunnels keep working without changes.
- **Phone-number format inconsistencies.** Inbound from Quickbase report = `(XXX) XXX-XXXX`; Bland = E.164; ReadyMode = digits only; KV keys = 10 digits. Always normalize at the edge.

---

## 16. Build plan (step by step)

### Phase 0 — bootstrap (1 hour)

1. `cd ~/Programming/sms-bot`
2. Drop your saved playground `main.ts` at the repo root as a reference (don't import from it).
3. Create `deno.json` with import map for `npm:postmark`, `npm:firebase-admin`, and tasks for `dev`, `test`, `migrate`, `shape-check`.
4. Create `src/server.ts` with a minimal `Deno.serve` that 200s `GET /healthz`. Verify locally: `deno task dev`.
5. Set env vars locally via a `.env` file (gitignored) + a `.env.example` that lists every variable from §13.

### Phase 1 — Firestore wrapper + migration dry-run (2-3 hours)

6. Create `src/firestore/client.ts`: thin wrapper exposing `get(path)`, `set(path, data)`, `delete(path)`, and `list(parentPath, opts)` over `npm:firebase-admin/firestore`.
7. Add `src/firestore/keys.ts` with helpers like `conversationDocPath(phone10, callId, ts)` and `scheduledInjectionPath(phone10)` mirroring §6.
8. Run the migration script in dry-run against a tiny prefix: `deno run -A scripts/migrate-kv-to-firestore.ts --dry-run --prefix=config`. Check the path/data output.
9. Real run for small prefixes (`config`, `saleswithin7d`, `injectionhistory`).
10. Real run for `conversations` + `scheduledinjection` (the large ones) — bump `--limit` if needed.

### Phase 2 — port the playground UI/API surface (1-2 days)

11. Move HTML strings (`homePageHtml`, `dashboardHtml`, `auditSearchHtml`, `searchPageHtml`, `injectionsPageHtml`, `reviewPageHtml`, `sharedThemeCss`) into `src/ui/*.ts`.
12. Port each playground route to its `src/routes/*` file. Replace the inline `kv.get/set/list` calls with the Firestore wrapper.
13. Add `Deno.test`s for normalizers (phone, stage), the appointment heuristic, and the audit dedupe (`saveAuditMarker` claim/override semantics).
14. Run `shape-checker` from the project root; address suggestions.
15. Smoke-test the dashboard locally — should render with migrated data.

### Phase 3 — port the omnisource SMS pipeline (2-4 days)

16. For each module under `_source-omnisource/sms-flow/`:
    - **kv/** → already replaced by `src/firestore/`; move the type defs (`SmsFlowContext`, `ConversationMessage`, `FutureInjection`) into `src/types/`.
    - **rate-limiter/**, **ab-test/**, **crm/**, **lead-orchestrator/** → strip `@Injectable`/`@Logger`, convert classes to factory functions, replace `node:http`/`node:https` with `fetch`.
    - **readymode/** (config, dto, mapping, service, campaigns) → port wholesale; this is the biggest module.
    - **trigger/**, **callback/**, **queue/** → port the controllers as plain `Deno.serve` route handlers.
17. Wire all routes into `src/server.ts`.
18. Implement `/api/guests/activate-from-report` (the new sale-match cron entry).
19. Tests: unit tests for the Quickbase phone-format normalization, the 7-day window check, the disposition switch in `/sms-callback/disposition`, and the gatekeepers in `/trigger/readymode`.
20. Run `shape-checker` again.

### Phase 4 — deploy + cutover (half day)

21. Create the Deno Deploy project, set all env vars from §13.
22. Deploy. Verify `/healthz`.
23. Run `Deno.cron("scheduled-injection-sweep", "* * * * *", () => fetch("/api/cron/trigger"))` inside the app, OR keep the existing external cron site and have it hit `/api/cron/trigger` every N minutes.
24. Repoint the daily cron site from the legacy `guest-activation/from-report` URL to the new `/api/guests/activate-from-report`.
25. Repoint the two ngrok tunnels (`conf-deploy.ngrok.app`, `conf-omnisource.ngrok.app`) at the new Deno Deploy URL — or change Bland/ReadyMode/Cal.com webhooks directly.
26. Watch logs for 24–48 hours. Keep the legacy KV deploy running read-only as a fallback until you're confident.

### Phase 5 — cleanup (1 hour)

27. Once the new app is stable, decommission `google-sheets-kv.thetechgoose.deno.net`.
28. Delete `_source-omnisource/` (or move it out of the repo).
29. Delete the legacy cron site if it had its own deploy.

## 17. Source folder map (`_source-omnisource/sms-flow/`)

What's in the dump and what to do with each piece during the port:

| Path | Contents | Port plan |
|---|---|---|
| `mod.ts` | NestJS `@Module` declaration | Discard — not needed in Deno.serve world |
| `ab-test/mod.ts` | A/B variant assignment | Port to `src/services/ab-test/` |
| `callback/mod.ts` | All `/sms-callback/*` controllers (single big file) | Split per route into `src/routes/callback/` |
| `crm/mod.ts` + `crm/dto/*` | Quickbase magic-mirror lookup | Port to `src/services/crm/` using your Quickbase client |

## 18. Open questions (fill in as decisions land)

- [ ] Quickbase auth model for non-`getReports` operations (user token? app token?). Add env vars to §13 once decided.
- [ ] Do we want Deno Deploy's built-in `Deno.cron` for the scheduled-injection sweep, or keep the external cron model? (Built-in cron is simpler; external cron decouples scheduling from the deploy.)
- [ ] Indexes: which composite indexes do we actually need on day 1 vs. add later when queries get slow?
- [ ] Backwards-compat for the ngrok tunnels — repoint them, or mount handlers at `/confirmations/v001/...` to keep them working unchanged?
- [ ] Do we need to port the `seedConversations` backfill endpoint, or is migration via the script enough?
- [ ] DNC: separate Firestore collection (`dnc/byPhone/{phone10}`) or just a flag inside `smsflowcontext`?
